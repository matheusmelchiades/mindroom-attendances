1. SQL

SQL is the go-to language for chatting with databases and keeping things organized. 
With SQL, you can pull up specific info, update records, add new entries, or delete data 
you don’t need anymore.

It’s the standard tool for working with relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL and 
is key to managing the data that powers most websites and apps out there.

2.	NoSQL
NoSQL is the more flexible version of a database, storing info in formats like documents, 
key-value pairs, or graphs instead of traditional tables. They’re great for handling big 
chunks of unstructured data and offer scalability, making them perfect for modern web apps 
that need a more relaxed approach to data management.

3.	PL/SQL and T-SQL
PL/SQL and T-SQL are SQL extensions used with specific databases—PL/SQL for Oracle and T-SQL 
for Microsoft SQL Server. They add procedural features like loops and conditions, allowing for 
more complex operations within the database, like writing stored procedures and triggers that 
automate tasks and boost performance.
